## boltzmann-generator-playground

This is a playground of [Boltzmann Generator](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/eaaw1147) codes. Here is the plan:

1. Explore the BG sampling model with PDZ3 datasets

2. Provide a more general workflow and preprocess scripts for using this framework in other proteins.

3. If necessay, upgrade to Tensorflow 2

Codes and notebooks in `example/` folder are provided by the authors of Boltzmann Generator paper at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3242635#.YIgr931KhTY)
